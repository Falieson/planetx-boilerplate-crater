With this first PlanetX repo I want to gain experience publishing a repo that's usable by others. My goal is to develop a few repos and tutorials from this exercise.
1. this repo [planetx-boilerplate-crater] to be used as a base for my other crater projects
1. a step-by-step guide for making planetx-boilerplate-crater which I may publish as a tutorial (`StepsAndCommits.md`)
1. another repo [planetx-tutorials-crater-counter] demonstrating using the skeleton to make a module style counter
1. a blog tutorial describing the 'how' and 'why' of planetx-tutorials-crater-counter
1. a blog tutorial describing the why of crater and 'inns and outs' (100 hours in crater...)
1. another repo [eslint-config-planetx] rather than airbnb with all my eslint config

This package is a fork of `falieson/crater` which is the fork I use to PR with `jcoreio/crater`. Sometimes they are slightly different.
