Project Description
======

Using 'crater' as a base, applying my preferences to create a new base for my future crater projects
------

Secondary Goals:
1. writeup on what is planetx
1. writeup why crater and 'inns and outs' (100 hours in crater...)
1. tutorial about planetx-crater-counter
1. [x] -another repo [eslint-config-planetx] rather than airbnb with all my eslint config-
