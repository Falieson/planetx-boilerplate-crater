Maintaining PlanetX Boilerplate Crater ("PX Crater")
======

This package is a fork of `falieson/crater` which is the fork I use to PR with `jcoreio/crater`. Sometimes falieson and jcoreio versions of crater are out-of-sync.

## Update PX Crater from jcoreio

1. update `falieson/crater` branch webpack2 w/ `jcoreio/crater`'s webpack2
1. update `falieson/planetx-boilerplate-crater` master with `falieson/crater`'s webpack2 branch

## Continuous Integration of PX Crater


## Publishing a new version of PX Crater
